# Graphs
Graphs are used to build a relational model between multiple nodes where it forms a network. Graphs consist of both nodes/vertices and edges/lines.

## Types of Graphs
### Cyclic vs. Acyclic
Cyclic graphs will have their nodes connected in a way that you can return back to the original node you started from, creating a circular motion. Acyclic graphs will not allow you to revisit nodes.

### Weighted vs. Unweighted
Weighted graphs will have a value applied to the edges (lines) along with their nodes while unweighted graphs will only have values for their nodes.

### Directed vs. Undirected
Directed graphs will have the flow of the graph nodes moving only in one direction while undirected graphs can flow from either direction.
